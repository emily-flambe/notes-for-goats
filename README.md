## How to Use Notes for Goats

### Workspaces

Workspaces are like separate notebooks that help you organize different areas of your life:

- Create separate workspaces for different jobs, projects, or contexts
- Each workspace has its own entities, notes, and relationships
- Switch between workspaces using the dropdown in the navigation bar

### Entities

Entities are the core building blocks in Notes for Goats:

1. **What are Entities?**
   - People (colleagues, clients, team members)
   - Projects (initiatives, products, assignments)
   - Teams (departments, working groups, committees)

2. **Creating Entities**
   - Navigate to "Entities" and click "New Entity"
   - Select a type (Person, Project, or Team)
   - Enter a name and optional details
   - Add tags to make entities easier to find

3. **Using Entities**
   - View all entities from the Entities page
   - Click on any entity to see its details and related notes
   - Filter entities by type or search by name/tags

### Notes

Notes let you capture information while automatically connecting to relevant entities:

1. **Creating Notes**
   - Navigate to "Notes" and click "New Note"
   - Give your note a title and content
   - Use #hashtags to reference entities (e.g., "Meeting with #Alice about #ProjectX")

2. **Entity References**
   - Any entity name preceded by # will be detected as a reference
   - Referenced entities appear at the bottom of the note
   - Click on a referenced entity to view its details

3. **Viewing Notes**
   - Browse all notes from the Notes page
   - Filter notes by date or search by content
   - View notes related to specific entities from their detail pages

### Relationships

Relationships help you track connections between entities:

1. **Relationship Types**
   - Define custom relationship types (e.g., "Reports To", "Works On")
   - Set whether relationships are directional (one-way) or bidirectional
   - Configure inverse names for directional relationships (e.g., "Reports To" ‚Üî "Manages")

2. **Creating Relationships**
   - From an entity's detail page, click "Add Relationship"
   - Select the relationship type and the related entity
   - Add optional details about the relationship

3. **Relationship Inference**
   - Set up rules to automatically create relationships based on patterns
   - Example: When two people work on the same project, create a "Collaborator" relationship
   - Automatically maintain your organizational structure with minimal effort

## Data Backup and Migration

Keep your valuable notes safe:

### Backup Options

1. **Export Workspaces (Recommended)**
   - From the Workspace Settings page, click "Export Workspace"
   - Saves all workspace data as a JSON file that can be imported later

2. **Direct Database Backup**
   - For standard installations: Copy the `db.sqlite3` file to a secure location
   - For Docker installations:
     ```bash
     docker-compose exec web bash -c "cd notes_for_goats && python manage.py export_data"
     ```

### Importing Data

1. **Import a Workspace**
   - From the Workspaces page, click "Import Workspace"
