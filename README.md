# Notes for Goats

A personal note-taking application designed for serious professionals (this could be you!) to organize structured notes about people, projects, and daily events.

## AI disclosure

This app was vibe-coded _par excellence_ with extremely heavy assistance from claude-3.7-sonnet.

I have no plans to productionize or monetize this application. Honestly, who has the time?

## Purpose

Notes for Goats solves the challenge of keeping structured, searchable notes on professional activities while maintaining data privacy through local storage. Unlike cloud-based solutions, this system gives you:

- Complete data ownership with local SQLite storage
- Entity-based organization (people, projects, teams)
- Integrated journaling with entity tagging via #hashtags
- Google Calendar event import capability
- Structured search and relationship browsing

Built by engineers for engineers, it emphasizes quick note-taking while automatically organizing information by entities.

## Getting Started

### Installation Options

#### Option 1: Using Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is with Docker, which handles all dependencies and environment setup automatically.

##### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (usually included with Docker Desktop)

##### Installation and Launch

1. Clone the repository
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/notes-for-goats.git
cd notes-for-goats
```

2. Build and start the application using Docker Compose
``` bash
docker-compose up -d
```

3. Create an admin user (first time only)
``` bash
docker-compose exec web python notes_for_goats/manage.py createsuperuser
```

4. Access the application
   - Main app: http://localhost:8000/

2. Create and activate a virtual environment
``` bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies
``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up the database
``` bash
python manage.py migrate
```

5. Create an admin user
``` bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

6. Run the development server
``` bash
python manage.py runserver
```

7. Access the application
   - Main app: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
   - Admin interface: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/

## Usage

### Core Functionality

1. **Creating Entities**
   - Navigate to "Entities" and click "New Entity"
   - Choose the type: Person, Project, or Team
   - Enter details and save

2. **Journal Entries**
   - Navigate to "Journal" and click "New Journal Entry"
   - Use #hashtags to reference entities (e.g., "Meeting with #Alice about #ProjectX")
   - Entities will be automatically linked if they exist in the system

3. **Entity References**
   - Click on any entity to see all journal entries that reference it
   - Explore relationships between people, projects, and teams

4. **Admin Interface**
   - Access powerful data management tools via the admin console
   - Bulk edit, search, and organize your data

### Relationships System

Notes for Goats features a powerful relationship management system that allows you to:

1. **Create Relationship Types**
   - Define custom relationship types like "Reports To", "Manages", "Collaborates With"
   - Configure if relationships are directional (one-way) or non-directional (mutual)
   - Set optional inverse names for directional relationships (e.g., "Reports To" ‚Üî "Manages")

2. **Connect Entities with Relationships**
   - Link any two entities with meaningful relationships
   - View an entity's relationships from their detail page
   - Add notes to relationships for additional context
   - Visualize connections through relationship graphs

3. **Automatic Relationship Inference**
   - Define inference rules to automatically create relationships based on shared connections
   - Example: When two people are members of the same team, automatically create a "Teammate" relationship
   - Supports bidirectional inference (relationships created in both directions)
   - Auto-inferred relationships are marked and can be managed separately from manual relationships

4. **Managing Relationship Rules**
   - Create, edit, and delete inference rules from the dedicated management page
   - Apply rules on-demand or automatically when new relationships are created
   - Control which types of relationships should trigger inference

This relationship system helps you map organizational structures, project involvement, and team connections with minimal manual effort.

### Google Calendar Integration (Future)

The system is designed to integrate with Google Calendar to:
- Import your daily events
- Generate journal templates pre-populated with meetings
- Link notes directly to calendar events

## Data Backup

Your data is stored in a SQLite database (`db.sqlite3`). To back up your data:

### Standard Installation Backup
1. Stop the application if it's running
2. Copy the `db.sqlite3` file to a secure location
3. For a more portable backup, use the export command:
``` bash
python manage.py export_data
```

### Docker Installation Backup
1. Export workspaces via the UI (recommended)
2. Or access the database file directly:
``` bash
docker-compose exec web bash -c "cd notes_for_goats && python manage.py export_data"
```

## Design Decisions

### Why Django?

Django was chosen for several reasons:
1. **Rapid Development**: Built-in admin, ORM, and templating
2. **Batteries Included**: Authentication, forms, and security
3. **Maintainable**: Clear MVC-like pattern with Django's MVT
4. **Local First**: Easy setup with SQLite for local data storage
5. **Python Ecosystem**: Access to libraries for calendar integration, data processing

### Why SQLite?

SQLite provides the perfect balance for a personal tool:
1. **Zero Configuration**: No database server required
2. **Portability**: Single file database that can be backed up anywhere
3. **Reliability**: ACID-compliant, trusted in mission-critical applications
4. **Local First**: Prioritizes data ownership and privacy

### Entity-Centered Design

The app revolves around the concept of entities (people, projects, teams):
1. **Centralized Information**: Each entity becomes a hub for related information
2. **Intuitive Tagging**: Natural writing with #hashtags maintains flow while creating structure
3. **Relationship Exploration**: Navigate between related entries and entities
4. **Flexible Journaling**: Combines the freedom of free-form writing with the structure of a database

### Relationship and Inference System

Our relationship system was designed with these principles:
1. **Flexibility**: Custom relationship types allow modeling any organizational structure
2. **Automation**: Inference rules reduce manual data entry by detecting patterns
3. **Transparency**: Auto-created relationships are clearly marked with their origin
4. **Integrity**: Manual relationships are never overwritten by automatic ones
5. **Discoverability**: Visual graph representations help explore complex networks

### Template-Based UI vs API+SPA

We chose Django templates for the UI because:
1. **Simplicity**: Faster development with fewer moving parts
2. **Cohesiveness**: Unified backend and frontend development
3. **Focus on Functionality**: Emphasizes core note-taking capabilities over UI sophistication
4. **Future Extensibility**: API endpoints can be added later if a more dynamic UI is desired

### Why Docker?

We offer Docker support because:
1. **Consistency**: Ensures the application runs the same way on every machine
2. **Isolation**: Keeps dependencies contained without affecting your system
3. **Simplicity**: Reduces setup time and configuration issues
4. **Portability**: Easy to move between systems or share with others
